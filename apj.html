    <h1> A. P. J. Abdul Kalam</h1>

    <h2> ☛ A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, was born on October 15, 1931, in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, India.<br><br>
         ☛ He served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007.<br><br>
         ☛ Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development               
Organisation (DRDO).<br><br>
         ☛ In 1969, he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the   first satellite launch vehicle that was
            both designed and produced in India.
            <br><br>
         ☛ Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which  helped earn him the nickname <strong>
           “Missile Man.”</strong>
            <br><br> 
         ☛ Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated  aspects of the SLV-III and was launched
            in 1989.
                <br><br> 
         ☛ He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, the first since
                the original nuclear test by India in 1974.
                <br><br> 
         ☛ From 1992 to 1997 Kalam was scientific adviser to the defense minister, and he later served as principal scientific adviser (1999–2001) to the
            government with the rank of cabinet minister.
                <br><br> 
         ☛ His prominent role in the country’s 1998 nuclear weapons tests solidified India as a nuclear power and established Kalam as a national hero,
                although the tests caused great concern
                in the international community.
                <br><br>
                <br><br> 
         ☛ While delivering a lecture at the Indian Institute of Management Shillong, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent cardiac arrest on 
               <b>27 July 2015</b>,  aged 83.
                <br><br>
         ☛ Wheeler Island, a national missile test site in Odisha, was renamed <b>Kalam Island</b> in September 2015.
                <br><br> 
         ☛ A prominent road in New Delhi was renamed from Aurangzeb Road to <b>Dr APJ Abdul Kalam Road</b> in August 2015.
                 <br><br>
         ☛ In February 2018, scientists from the Botanical Survey of India named a newly found plant species as Drypetes kalamii, in his honour.
